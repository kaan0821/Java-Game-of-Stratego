In Square.java, I implemented a new method isEnemy(). It checks whether the piece on the target square is an enemy (ie,belongs to the opponent)

In Piece.java, I implemented a new method getAdjacentSquares(). It returns all the adjacent square from four directions, doesn't check if occupied or is water.
